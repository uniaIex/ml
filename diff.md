- **Examples**:  
  - Rule-based: Chess-playing engines, basic chatbots.  
  - Learning-based: Self-driving cars, voice assistants.  

**Subfields**:  
- Machine Learning  
- Computer Vision  
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)  
- Robotics

## 2. **Machine Learning (ML)**  
**Definition**:  
A subset of AI focused on developing algorithms that learn patterns from data *without explicit programming*.  

**Key Characteristics**:  
- **Data-Driven**: Improves performance with more data.  
- **Types**:  
  - Supervised Learning (labeled data)  
  - Unsupervised Learning (unlabeled data)  
  - Reinforcement Learning (reward-based learning)  
- **Examples**:  
  - Email spam filters.  
  - Predictive text suggestions.  

**Common Algorithms**:  
- Decision Trees  
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
- **Neural Networks** (see below)

## 3. **Neural Networks (NN)**  
**Definition**:  
A specific class of machine learning algorithms inspired by the human brainâ€™s structure, using interconnected nodes ("neurons") to process data.  

**Key Characteristics**:  
- **Structure**: Layers of neurons (input, hidden, output).  
- **Deep Learning**: A subset using **deep neural networks** (many hidden layers).  
- **Examples**:  
  - Image recognition (e.g., identifying cats in photos).  
  - Speech-to-text systems.  

**Types**:  
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for images.  
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequences (e.g., text).  
- Transformers (e.g., GPT-4 for language tasks).

### Hierarchy Recap:
- **AI**: The overarching concept (e.g., self-driving cars).  
- **ML**: A toolset within AI for learning from data (e.g., training a recommendation system).  
- **NN**: A specialized ML technique for complex pattern recognition (e.g., facial recognition models).  


Tensors ->
    "A tensor is a generalization of vectors and matrices to potentially higher dimensions. Internally, TensorFlow represents tensors as n-dimensional arrays of base datatypes." (https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/tensor)

    It should't surprise you that tensors are a fundemental apsect of TensorFlow. They are the main objects that are passed around and manipluated throughout the program. Each tensor represents a partialy defined computation that will eventually produce a value. TensorFlow programs work by building a graph of Tensor objects that details how tensors are related. Running different parts of the graph allow results to be generated.

    Each tensor has a data type and a shape.

    Data Types Include: float32, int32, string and others.

    Shape: Represents the dimension of data.

    Just like vectors and matrices tensors can have operations applied to them like addition, subtraction, dot product, cross product etc.
